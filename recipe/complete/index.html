            <p class="subheading">Filling</p>
            <p>12 oz cream cheese softened to room temperature</p>
            <p>1/2 cup powdered sugar whisked to remove any lumps</p>
            <p>1/2 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste</p>
            <p>1/2 tsp almond extract</p>
            <p>zest of 1 large lemon</p>
            <p>1/2 large lemon juiced</p>
            <p class="subheading">Dough</p>
            <p>1 sheet puff pastry thawed and rolled out a little until it's an even thickness</p>
            <p class="subheading">Egg wash</p>
            <p>1 large egg</p>
            <p>1 Tbsp water</p>
            <p class="subheading">Sweet lemon glaze</p>
            <p>1/2 cup powdered sugar whisked to remove any lumps</p>
            <p>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice</p>
            <p>1/2 Tbps heavy cream or milk</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Prepare</p>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Make the filling</p>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl, add cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, lemon zest and lemon juice.  Beat with a handheld mixer until well combined and creamy.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Prepare dough</p>
            <p>On prepared baking sheet, or a large cutting board, unroll thawed puff pastry sheet. Roll out a little to flatten the dough out.</p>
            <p>Carefully cut slits, about 1.5-2” long and 1” apart going down the side of the sheet.  Repeat on opposite side.</p>
            <img class="image3" src= "../images/new danish 2.jpg">
            <p class="subheading">Assemble</p>
            <p>Spoon the cream cheese mixture down the center of the puff pastry sheet, leaving a small border between the mixture and the slits.</p>
            <p>Cross the strips over the top of the cream cheese mixture, alternating from one side, then the other, overlapping the ends in the middle.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Egg wash</p>
            <p>Whisk together the egg and water and brush over the top of the braided pastry.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Bake</p>
            <p>Bake for 20-25 minutes, until pastry is golden brown.</p>
            <p>Pastry will be puffed up, but will settle as it cools.  Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Make glaze</p>
            <p>While pastry is cooling, add glaze ingredients in a small mixing bowl.  Whisk until creamy and smooth.</p>
            <p class="subheading">Serve</p>
            <p>Drizzle some of the glaze over the top of the pastry.</p>
            <p>Serve warm, or store in the refrigerator, and drizzle with any remaining glaze, if desired.</p>
