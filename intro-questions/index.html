        <h1>Intro Questions</h1> 
        <p>1. My name is Cameron Thompson. I am a junior majoring in Global Studies and minoring in Chinese Studies and Design.</p>  
        <p>2. In college, my background in Global Studies and Chinese for the most part. In high school I did a lot of design and Computer-Aided Design, and I have recently gone back to that. After diving deeper into career research, I decided I wanted to do UX Design. I declared a minor in design and am currently working towards finding internships and experience that will land me a job in UX Design.</p> 
        <p>3. I have no experinece with HTML/CSS, except for doing the "Hello World" exercise with my cousin and one brief assignment to make a website of an article in my Type 1 class.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to begin building my portfolio with web-design and UX-related things.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing for a screen will be different because I think it has to do a lot with what you type and then how you translate that into a physical design, whereas with designing for paper you usually start with rough sketches that get more deatiled as you develop the idea. I think having a limited coding background could limit the complexity of my designs.</p>
        <p>6. https://twitter.com/ I think Twitter is effective because it has clear headings and sub-headings that show different things you might want to look into. The trending tags on the opening page are enticing and make you want to stay up to date with what is happening, which makes you want to use Twitter more. I think Twitter is trying to move away from being just a site where people say things to a news and entertainment site, so the headings, subheadings, and trending tags help the user get into that.</p>
        <p>7. https://www.nytimes.com/ I think the NY Times is effective because it shows pieces of articles that draw you in, as well as clear headings so you can look into exactly what you want. Having options to browse articles based on categories helps you find content that is within your interests but still lets you discover new things. I think the font choices help create a brand for the NY Times and help it look very official. The images also draw you in and communicate what the article is going to be about.</p>
        <p>8. https://www.oliviatruong.design/ I found this website/UX portfolio when looking for portfolio examples and I liked it because it looked super clean but was still artistic and communicated exactly where you could find different parts of her portfolio. It is visually appealing, simple, has a nice homepage, and has clear menu options.</p>
